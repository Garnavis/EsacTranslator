# EsAC Translator #

The EsAC translator reads Essen Associative Code (EsAC) and translates it to
another textual music language.  Currently, that language is JFugue, although
others will be added.

Output languages to be added:

* [Silica](https://github.com/gatesphere/silica)
* [LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org/)
